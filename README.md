# LogMyTime
This Windows app aims to assist people on keeping track of their attendance at work by registering the periods of time on which their workstation are in use. To do that, this software agent is automatically launched when the computer is turned on and it keeps tracking and persisting activity records during all day long. As it constantly persists data at a local storage, power drops are not likely to affect its functionality. What if you don't turn on/off your workstation between two or more days? As it registers only the first and last user interactions (through keyboard and mouse events) of each day, no records will exist during periods of inactivity between dates (therefore, using the computer at early morning, spending the whole day away from it and using it again before midnight will be seen like you worked the whole day).
